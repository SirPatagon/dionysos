# Project Dionysos (Name pending)

**Project Dionysos** is going to be an online party game collection.

## ToDos:

Anything marked with an (α) is mandatory for the first prerelease version.

### Frontend:

- ☑ (α) Main menu
- ☐ (α) A scaling component like in the main menu but reusable
- ☐ Fancy page transitions
- ☐ A name for this thing
- ☐ Logo/Design document/Art style

### Backend:

- ☐ (α) Anything at all
- ☐ (α) Game session logic (so that multiple players can play together using a code or something)
- ☐ (α) Abstraction level that every game can have its own API but share some things like the session
- ☐ (α) Extend the .editorconfig with language specific definitions (C#/F#/Whatever we use)
- ☐ (α) Any IoC Framework
- ☐ Storage? (do we need any? If so, why?)

### Overall:

#### Games:

- ☐ (α) A basic Fibbage-like game to establish the basics in communication
- ☐ (α) Trivia Quiz
- ☐ A team drawing game. Draw something together at the same time and fight against other teams! (Although maybe just as option for other drawing games?)
- ☐ A Montagsmaler game (no fucking clue how it's called in English)
- ☐ Tron
- ☐ Crossword puzzle
- ☐ Word guessing with proximity of meaning to the word searched

#### Misc:

- ☐ Multi language support
- ☐ Find a solution for synchronizing live drawing to other clients
- ☐ Look into WebRTC. It may be useful for most of our games. Maybe even the solution to the previous point!
- ☐ Do we want per game sessions or an overall session for all games?
- ☐ Where do we get our words for out word games from? (especially in other languages)
- ☐ A better roadmap!
